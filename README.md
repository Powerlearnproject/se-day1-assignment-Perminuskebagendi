Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a discipline that seeks to solve real world problems efficiently by designing,building, testing and debugging program codes.
software engineering is important in these aspects:
 solves realworld problems
 creates employment for software engineers, project managers, software tessters and quality assurance personels and many other in the line of technology
 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

prject acceptance and approval
Design approval. involves the clients satisfaction with the presented design.
post deployment reviews. remarks on the software product goes a long way in defining future improvements


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

user specification. user needs and requirements are collected.
problem statement. the problem to be solved is clearly defined from the user specifications and requirements.
Design. A model of the solutionis designed and simulated to establish whether it sorts the defined problem.
Codding. the actual development of the software to solve the stated problem. the program is subject to testing and evaluation after implementation.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile methodology has to do with breaking a project down into discrete phases thus encouraging collaborations and continuous improvement.
example building a fully functional e commerce. a team works on the inventory, another on the UX IX design, another on payment API integrations and another on the back end.
Waterfall methodology involves having a project as a sum of its sequential phases. wxample is a simple website design involving gathering user specificartions, development requirements, 
designing, building, testing and debugging and finally deployment.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer works in collaboration with relevant parties in the field to build efficient software programs.
A Quality Assuarance Engineer has the role of ensuring the developed software meets the quality standard as in the program must have a very high accuracy percentages n free from errors as much possible
Product Manager supports the product designers, developers and quality assuarance personells in the software development process ensuring the desirfed product is attained in the most appropeiate timeframe with feasible resources in perspective.
sofware engineering team is


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are softwares that provide a user with readily available tools for building software projects.
 eg Visual Studio code and Php storm.
 Version Control Systems (VCS) are systems that keep track of the various development processes. eg Bitkeeper
 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
unclear objective declaration. 
overcomed by engaging the client carefully to clearly define their specifications.
underestimation and overesttimation.
overcomed by conducting a thorough feasibility study.
Skewd scope.
overcomed by accurate allocation of time to engineering activities.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing is testing done at a component level of a system
system testing is testing done to the entire system with all the unit components integrated.
acceptance . the degree to which the build system meets the user specifications or the objectives.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
a means of interacting with artificial intelligence models by qurrying and getting resonce.

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
it forms a basis of interaction btn users and the AI models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
generate an image of a teen african boy with short black hair in a grey suit and black shoes.
the pompt is more acurate since the details given filter out other possible results leaving the best output
